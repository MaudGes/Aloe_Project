# Aloe_Project

This is the 2 weeks real world project realised to validate the data analysis bootcamp. To be able to publicly show this data. Everything has been anonymized.
The data used here also stop at the end of August 2022 to avoid giving the latest information.

The company is a young company that manufactures and sell pharmaceutical products made with Aloe Vera to pharmacies in France.

You can find:
A file containing all sales and information needed to identify a sale.
A file with all the client's (pharmacies') names and information (address, email and anything that allows identification have been removed).
A file containing all the sales representatives' information to be able to identify who made a sale (first and last names have been changed).

Common keys : 
- Between Sales and Clients : "code_cip_id". The CIP code is a unique identifier for pharmaceutical establishments.
- Between Salesrep and Sales : "salesrep_id"

The project is not finished yet, however, by the bootcamp's requirements, the data visualisation will be made in tableau. Once everything is done, I will add a link to 
Tableau public to allow everyone to see the results !

Thank you!
Maud
