# Aloe_Project
Commercial Data Analysis projects for a young pharmaceutical company

This is a personal project to help a young company. To be able to publicly show this data. Everything has been anonymized.
The data used here also stops at the end of August 2022 to avoid giving the latest information.

The company manufactures and sells pharmaceutical products made with Aloe Vera to pharmacies in France.

You can find:
A file containing all sales and information needed to identify a sale.

A file with all the client's (pharmacies') names and information (address, email and anything that allows identification have been removed).

A file containing all the sales representatives' information to be able to identify who made a sale (first and last names have been changed).


The "cleaned sales" file is the outpout of the data cleaning the notebook. To deepen the analysis, data visualisation will be made in tableau.

Thank you!
